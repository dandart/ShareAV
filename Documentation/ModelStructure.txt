Model Structure

All models should:
    Know how to fetch and get fields

Base Models should:

    Have a final protected __constuct() - customisation in static ::create()s
    Know how to save themselves (and be able to consistently)
    Be compatible with (but independent from) NoSQL
    Have an array of fields inline

Child Models should:
    
    Require a base
    Have a final protected __construct(Base)
    Have an array of fields inline

Fields should have:
    Name
    Behaviour type (field, child multiple/single, inline/embedded (only NoSQL), idref, collection idrefs
    Optional data type (int/string/etc) - later
